Research Paper Copilot
An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for intelligent querying of research papers, providing accurate page-level citations.
Overview
Research Paper Copilot enables users to upload research papers in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and query their content with precise, context-aware responses. The system leverages advanced natural language processing and vector search to deliver answers with verifiable page-level citations, making it ideal for researchers, students, and academics.
Technical Architecture
Core Pipeline

Document Ingestion: Processes documents while preserving metadata.
Semantic Chunking: Splits content with page boundary tracking for accurate citations.
Vector Embeddings: Uses SentenceTransformers for efficient text representation.
Vector Storage: Employs ChromaDB for scalable and fast vector retrieval.
LLM Integration: Supports multiple models (local and OpenAI API) for flexible inference.

Key ML Engineering Features

Custom Chunking Strategy: Ensures citation context is preserved during document processing.
Hybrid Retrieval: Combines semantic search with similarity filtering for precise results.
Structured Prompt Engineering: Delivers consistent and reliable outputs.
Real-Time Inference: Validates citations during response generation.
